# Stardew Planner v3 [BETA]
A brand new, shiny version of the Stardew Valley planner. Still under development though.

# Whats NEW?
There were several main goals for yet another full rewrite of the planner.

* **Actual sprites** - The planner now uses full sized sprites to give better idea of how your farm will actually look in the game without needing of rendering. It's planned to support all seasons with a press of a button!
* **Mobile support [WIP]** - As the game itself released on mobile, I was also taking on a task to make the planner at least somewhat usable in mobile. This is still on-going process, but I now have to tools to support it.
* **Built in UI** - All of planners core UI is now part of the planner itself which gives better control over it.

# How does it work?
If you have used the old planner... pretty much the same way. You select things from the menus, place them, try to make your plan look nice or optimal. 
- Esc will close menus
- Holding shift will allow you place multiple items in a row
- Selecting an item and pressing Esc will delete it

# How to leave feedback
Use GitHub issue tracker to do so. There are guidelines how to submit a good issue when posting a new one. You'll need github account (free) to do so. If it seems like too much effort you could just email me as well or poke in Discord

# Other notes
## I can't see any code?!
The new version of the planner is not open source.   
This repository here is a place to voice your feedback and report any issues.

## It looks half-done, why release it before it's ready?
I've been sitting on the v3 version for over a year, making small to no progress due to lack of motivation and / or time. Getting it out there and receiving feedback from actual users, having discussions over what to do and how and maybe even getting a hand to help out will hopefully push me enough to finish it.
