I'll try to keep track of changes here that are published live to https://v3.starfew.info   
If it's been a long while since the last release it's because I have a life to manage.

## 2023-04-11 - first public release
Initial public release of the beta version

Biggest things to note:
* Fully new engine, rewritten from scratch using pixi.js
* Full sized sprites! The planner finally looks more like the actual game and doesn't need rendering (which was broken and didn't support custom layouts)
* Potential mobile support (not very good yet, still trying to make it good)
* Most of the old planner functionalities should work
* All old plans are compatible with the new planner.
